# Keyjam

Keyjam tracks your keyboard "streaks" when you're in the flow, encouraging you to use your keyboard more and your mouse less.

## What's the Jam?

Ever notice how satisfying it feels when you're absolutely crushing it on the keyboard like a maestro on the keys? That smooth flow when you're navigating, coding, or writing without reaching for the mouse? 

## Features

- macOS menubar app
- Counts your key 'streak' as it happens.  If you use the mouse, it breaks the streak.  Sad sound triggers when you break an extended streak.
- Push yourself to learn keyboard shortcuts for everything and navigating between apps -or- focus/filter to only specific apps if that is your jam
