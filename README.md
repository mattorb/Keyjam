# Keyjam

Ever notice how satisfying it feels when you're absolutely crushing it on the [computer] keyboard, like a maestro on the keys? That smooth flow when you're navigating, coding, or writing without reaching for the mouse? 

Keyjam is a macOS status menu app that tracks your keyboard streaks, encouraging you to use your keyboard more and your mouse less.

## Features

- macOS status menu app
- Counts your key 'streak' as it happens.  If you use the mouse, that breaks the streak.
- Open source so you can be sure nothing is logging your keypresses
- Uses built-in macOS mechanism for key and mouse event capture that automatically exclude keypresses in password/secure fields
- Choose to either push yourself to learn keyboard shortcuts for system wide (resize windows, app switching/navigation, all apps) -OR- focus/filter on keyboard usage only for specific apps if that is more your jam
